# sidekiq_publisher

## (Unreleased)
- Changing the `Job#args` validator to be a manual check instead of using the `exclusions` validator.  This is to fix an issue introduced with rails 6.1 and the condition of `in: [nil]`.  More details [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/41051).

## v2.0.0
- Transition from defining a Railtie to becoming a Rails Engine
  [(#44)](https://github.com/ezcater/sidekiq_publisher/pull/44). This change was
  made to better support Ruby 3.0 and Rails 6.1. The change is *not* expected to
  be breaking but it does represent a major change in the gem's implementation
  and that is the reason for the major version bump.
- Require Ruby 2.6 or later.
